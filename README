# Trade Tracker

Utility I use to keep track of my trades. This repository includes a copy
of historic Bitstamp price data that I obtained on 2021-01-09 from
[Bitcoincharts](https://bitcoincharts.com/about/markets-api/), but data
beyond that (though it can be found on Bitcoincharts) is assumed to be
downloaded in real-time.

## Security / Robustness

This is not a cryptography-related crate. I have made no effort to minimize
my dependency tree, maintain a particular minimum supported Rust version,
maintain a stable API or even command-line interface, etc. etc. It is
published on Github mainly as a means of archival. Use at your own risk.

Having said that, PRs and issues are welcome.

## Price Data

This utility records historic Bitcoin price data at 30-minute increments,
using the last trade from Bitstamp at each time. You can load it with
initial data using

    trade-tracker initialize-price-data prices.csv

where you get `prices.csv` from Bitcoincharts, or by decompressing the
`xz` file included in this repo, or whatever. You can later update it
using

    trade-tracker update-price-data 'http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/trades.csv?symbol=bitstampUSD'

though please, for the sake of keeping that API free, don't do this
more than every half hour. The tool will just throw away non-30-minute
data anyway.
